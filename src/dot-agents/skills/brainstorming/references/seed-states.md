# Seed States (S1-S5)

Five states describing what kind of idea seed you have and how to expand it.

## S1: Adjacent-Ready

**Signals:**
- Seed is concrete and specific
- Clear what it does, unclear what's next
- Feels like "step one" of something larger

**Key Questions:**
1. What becomes possible once this exists that wasn't possible before?
2. What's the natural next step someone would want?
3. What would you build on top of this?

**Expansion: Map the Adjacent Possible**

List 3-5 things that become reachable from this seed:
- What doors does this open?
- What becomes cheaper/easier once this exists?
- What's the obvious sequel?

Pick the most interesting adjacent possibility and repeat the process.

## S2: Collision-Hungry

**Signals:**
- Seed feels incomplete on its own
- Sense that it needs "something else"
- Works in some contexts but not others

**Key Questions:**
1. What domain has never seen this idea?
2. What past work does this remind you of?
3. Who would find this obvious? Who would find it alien?

**Expansion: Force Collisions**

Throw material at the seed until something sticks:

**Domain Collision:**
- How would [unrelated field] see this seed?
- What would a [profession] do with this?

**Artifact Collision:**
- What past work connects to this?
- What existing tool/tech could combine with this?

**Constraint Collision:**
- What happens under unusual constraints?
- What if you had 10x resources? 1/10th?

**Inversion Collision:**
- What's the opposite?
- What breaks if inverted?

Use random domain generators if stuck.

## S3: Half-Baked Hunch

**Signals:**
- Can't fully articulate the idea yet
- Feels important but fuzzy
- "There's something here but I can't name it"

**Key Questions:**
1. What's the part you CAN articulate clearly?
2. What question would this answer if it were finished?
3. What's missing—a mechanism? An example? A use case?

**Expansion: Preserve and Name the Gap**

Don't force completion:
1. Articulate what you have clearly (even if partial)
2. Name the gap specifically: "I need [X] to make this complete"
3. Keep the hunch alive by writing it down
4. Look for collisions that might fill the gap over time

The goal isn't to finish it now—it's to stay alert for what completes it.

## S4: Error-Rich

**Signals:**
- Seed has been tried and failed
- Know what doesn't work
- Failure feels informative, not terminal

**Key Questions:**
1. What specifically broke? (Mechanism, context, execution?)
2. What did the failure reveal about the problem structure?
3. What would have to change for this to work?

**Expansion: Mine the Failure**

Errors contain information about solution shape:
1. List what you learned from the failure
2. Identify which assumptions were wrong
3. Look for adjacent seeds that avoid the failure modes
4. Ask: "What would work where this didn't?"

Failure is data. The error reveals the structure of the problem space.

## S5: Exaptation Candidate

**Signals:**
- Seed works well for its original purpose
- Sense it could do something else entirely
- "This reminds me of X" where X is unrelated

**Key Questions:**
1. What job was this seed built to do?
2. What other jobs share similar structure?
3. Where would transplanting this seed be surprising but plausible?

**Expansion: Deliberate Transplantation**

Test the seed in alien soil:
1. List 5 completely different contexts
2. For each: What changes? What survives? What's gained?
3. Does any transplant reveal something about the seed you didn't see?

Example transplants:
- Take a SaaS pricing model → apply to healthcare
- Take a game mechanic → apply to education
- Take a manufacturing process → apply to creative work

The value is often in the friction—what has to change reveals what the seed actually is.
