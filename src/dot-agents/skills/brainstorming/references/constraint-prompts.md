# Constraint Prompts for Entropy Injection

Random constraints that force exploration of non-adjacent possibility space.

## Constraint Categories

### Actor Constraints

Change WHO is involved:

- A 10-year-old must be able to use it
- Someone hostile to the goal must benefit
- The person who caused the problem must solve it
- It must work for someone with no technical background
- The busiest person in the organization must do it
- It must be usable by someone doing 5 other things simultaneously

### Resource Constraints

Change what you have to work with:

- 1/10th the budget
- 10x the budget (what would you do differently?)
- Can't use the obvious technology
- Must use only existing tools (no new purchases)
- Must be implementable in one day
- Must be maintainable by one person
- No dedicated team—must piggyback on existing workflows

### Timing Constraints

Change WHEN it happens:

- Must be instant (no delay)
- Must be 10x slower (deliberate friction)
- Happens exactly once (no iteration)
- Happens continuously (always running)
- Must work retroactively (fix past instances)
- Must work predictively (prevent before happens)

### Combination Constraints

Force unlikely pairings:

- Must also solve [unrelated problem]
- Must NOT do the expected thing
- Must combine two approaches that usually conflict
- Must serve two user groups with opposite needs
- Must work both online and offline simultaneously

### Inversion Constraints

Flip the script:

- What if failure was the goal? (Now design for success)
- What if the constraint was the feature?
- What if the problem was the solution?
- What if the user was the provider?
- What if we charged MORE? (What would justify it?)
- What if it had to be worse? (What would be worth preserving?)

## How to Use

1. Pick ONE constraint (don't combine multiple)
2. Accept the constraint fully (don't water it down)
3. Generate 3-5 ideas that satisfy the constraint
4. Evaluate which ideas surprise you
5. Ask: What does this reveal about default assumptions?

The constraint is a probe. It reveals where you're making unconscious assumptions by forcing you to violate them.

## Example Application

**Problem:** Improve team communication

**Constraint:** "Someone hostile to it must benefit"

**Ideas generated:**
- Pair rotations: No team meetings. Information spreads through rotating pairs. Introverts prefer.
- Silence budget: Each person has limited "interrupt" tokens per week. Forces prioritization.
- Grandmother test: Any announcement must be understandable to a non-technical family member. Forces clarity.

These ideas are orthogonal to the default ("more meetings/better tools") because the constraint forced a different axis entirely.
