# Convergence Blind Spots (B1-B4)

States where brainstorming produces predictable, clustered ideas rather than genuine divergence.

## B1: First-Attractors (Convergence Blindness)

**Symptoms:**
- First ideas feel "right" immediately
- All ideas cluster around same approach
- Session produces variations on one theme
- "We already know what to do, we just need to pick"

**Diagnostic Questions:**
1. What's the most obvious solution? Have you named it explicitly?
2. Would three different people produce the same list?
3. Are you exploring the space or confirming an intuition?
4. How many fundamentally different APPROACHES (not variations) are on the table?

**Intervention:**
1. Run Default Enumeration: List 5-10 obvious ideas, explicitly labeled as defaults
2. Purpose: Make attractors visible—you cannot escape what you haven't named

## B2: Function-Lock

**Symptoms:**
- Ideas all take the same form
- Discussion assumes solution type ("We need an app that...")
- Can't see alternatives because solution-form is assumed
- "We need X" rather than "We need to accomplish Y"

**Diagnostic Questions:**
1. What must this accomplish? (Not: what should it be?)
2. Could something completely different achieve the same outcome?
3. What problem are you actually solving vs. what solution are you attached to?
4. What constraints are real vs. assumed?

**Intervention:**
1. Run Function Extraction: Separate WHAT from HOW
2. List 3-5 core functions independent of form
3. Reframe: "We need [FORM]" → "We need to [FUNCTION] and [FORM] is one way"

**Example:**
- "We need a mobile app" → "We need users to accomplish X on the go, and a mobile app is one form"
- "We need weekly meetings" → "We need information to flow between teams, and meetings are one mechanism"

## B3: Axis-Collapse

**Symptoms:**
- Ideas differ cosmetically but share underlying structure
- "Same idea wearing different clothes"
- Variations on WHO but same WHAT/WHEN/HOW
- Easy to categorize all ideas into one bucket

**Diagnostic Questions:**
1. What's the obvious WHO for this? Have you tried a completely different who?
2. What's the obvious WHEN? What if it was 10x slower? Instant? Recurring vs. one-time?
3. What's the obvious SCALE? What about 10x bigger? 10x smaller?
4. What's the obvious METHOD? What's a completely different approach?

**Intervention:**
1. Run Axis Mapping: Map default solution on four axes
2. Rotate at least one axis to break the pattern

**Axis Mapping Template:**

| Axis   | Question                  | Default            | Alternatives                  |
|--------|---------------------------|--------------------|-------------------------------|
| Who    | Who does/uses/owns this?  | [obvious actor]    | 3 unlikely actors             |
| When   | What timeframe/frequency? | [obvious timing]   | Different cadence             |
| Scale  | What size/scope?          | [obvious scale]    | 10x bigger? 10x smaller?      |
| Method | What approach/mechanism?  | [obvious approach] | Completely different approach |

**Key Insight:** Ideas feel predictable when they match "likely" on all four axes. Change ANY axis and the idea becomes less obvious.

## B4: Domain-Prison

**Symptoms:**
- All ideas come from same reference class
- "How we always do it" or "how our industry does it"
- Solutions are obvious to anyone in the field
- No ideas from adjacent or distant domains

**Diagnostic Questions:**
1. What field/industry does this idea come from?
2. What domain has definitely solved something similar?
3. How would a completely different profession approach this?
4. What industry would find this problem trivial?

**Intervention:**
1. Run Domain Import: Generate ideas applying logic from 3+ unrelated fields
2. Use constraint prompts with domains category
3. Apply entropy injection with random domain constraints

**Domain Collision Prompts:**
- How would military logistics solve this?
- How would a kindergarten teacher approach this?
- What would a biologist notice that you're missing?
- How does nature solve this problem?

## B5: Productive Divergence (Target State)

**Symptoms:**
- Ideas span different forms, scales, actors, and timeframes
- Evaluation problem (too many options) rather than generation problem
- Some ideas feel uncomfortable or surprising
- Hard to group all ideas into one cluster

**Diagnostic Questions:**
1. Which criteria should filter these?
2. What's the minimum viable experiment for top candidates?
3. Which ideas can be combined?
4. Which ideas serve different user segments?

**Next Step:**
Move to evaluation framework. Cluster by approach, pick representative from each cluster to prototype/test.
